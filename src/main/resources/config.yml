# TotalXPRewards configuration
#
# This file defines the XP reward thresholds and associated commands
# or broadcast messages. When a player reaches a threshold for the
# first time, all configured commands are executed (in order) and the
# broadcast message is sent to all players.
#
# Commands and broadcasts support the following placeholders:
#   %player%      - the player's name
#   %xp%          - the player's new total XP
#   %threshold%   - the threshold that was reached
#
# If PlaceholderAPI is installed and enabled, additional placeholders
# will be processed as well.

# NOTES:
#
# - You may define as many reward thresholds as you want.
# - Commands run as CONSOLE (no slash needed).
# - You may include 1 or MANY commands per reward.
# - The plugin remains BACKWARDS COMPATIBLE:
#     command: "give %player% stone 1"
#   still works, but “commands:” is recommended.
