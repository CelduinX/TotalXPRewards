# Total XP Rewards

A powerful and lightweight Paper plugin that tracks each player's **lifetime XP** and executes **custom rewards** when XP milestones are reached.
Fully configurable, translation-ready, and built for modern Paper servers (1.21+).

---

## ✨ Features

- **Global Total XP Tracking** 📈
  - Tracks XP from killing mobs, mining, **and** vanilla commands (`/xp`, `/experience`).
  - Never resets, even after death.
  - **Async Caching**: High-performance data handling prevents server lag.
- **BossBar Progress System** 📊
  - Displays a customizable BossBar showing progress to the next rank.
  - **Dynamic Mode**: Auto-hides the bar when not gaining XP.
  - **Rich Text support**: Supports **MiniMessage** (Gradients, RGB) AND Legacy Color Codes (`&a`) simultaneously!
- **Reward System** 🎁
  - Execute multiple commands when reaching a threshold.
  - Send custom broadcast messages.
  - Supports **Minecraft Target Selectors** in commands (e.g., `@a`, `@p`).
- **Full Customization** 🛠️
  - **PlaceholderAPI** support.
  - Complete language control via `lang.yml` (including "Max Rank" text).
  - **SQLite** storage with automatic schema migration (external apps can read `current_rank`).
